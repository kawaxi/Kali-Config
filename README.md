# Kali-Setup
Fully automated Bash script to setup your Kali system, Tested on Vmware x64.

The idea came to me when I was taking OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)  , even tho I have worked hard on it its far from perfection, I used this script as learning process as well wich is the reason on why I do several things on several ways.

I did use some lines from G0tmilk script however must of lines can be found on the web.

Confiuration of the IRC bouncer its not perfect, Please feel free to do your own contribution.
